# API Documentation Postman Collection Git Repo

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a popular tool that provides an easy-to-use interface to send HTTP requests. The Step-by-Step tutorials in the Forge Portal uses [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) to send HTTP requests. This repository contains the Postman versions of some of these tutorials. 

Postman has the advantage of being able to parse responses to an HTTP request and save response parameters to variables. These variables can thereafter be used as input parameters for subsequent HTTP request. 

**Note:**
- Not all Forge tutorials have a corresponding Postman Collection. 

- You can learn how to install and use Postman from [here](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates).
