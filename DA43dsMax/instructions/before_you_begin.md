2. Import *DA43dsMax Tutorial.postman_environment.json*:

    1. In the Postman header bar, click **Import**. A dialog box displays.

    2. Drag the file you downloaded in Step 1 to the area marked **Drop files here**. Alternatively, you can click **Choose Files** and find the file you downloaded in Step 1.

3. Click the environment drop-down on the upper-right, and select **DA43dsMax Tutorial**. The DA43dsMax Tutorial environment loads.
